Designing platform of a website to trade shares gathering information from finance.yahoo.com. I was expected to design few functions like buying, selling, quote, and portfolio display and other functions by creating some new files and editing some existing one. I was provided with few files that contained functions that i used in this project. It was one of my Problem Sets known as pset7.
